## User Experience (UX)

### The Idea

**Run it!** is designed to be a comprehensive running event listing website. Users can effortlessly find free running events in their area and book their spots. Additionally, they can post questions about specific events, add likes, and easily contact the site webmaster.

### The Ideal User

**Target Audiences:**
- Runners of all levels interested in participating in running events.
- Race Organisers who want to list events and manage bookings through the site admin.

**The ideal user:**
- Enjoys running and wants to participate in events.
- Desires to manage their own registrations.
- Aims to connect with other runners in their community.
- Seeks to promote and manage their events via the platform.

### Site Goals

1. **Facilitate Event Discovery:**
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for runners to easily find and book running events in their area.

2. **Enhance User Engagement:**
   - Enable users to post questions, add likes, and interact with other runners and event organisers within the platform.

3. **Streamline Event Management:**
   - Offer race organisers robust tools to list events, manage bookings, and communicate with participants efficiently.

4. **Promote Community Connection:**
   - Foster a community of runners by allowing users to connect, share experiences, and support each other through the platform.

5. **Ensure Smooth Registration Process:**
   - Simplify the registration process for runners, making it easy for them to sign up for events and manage their registrations.

6. **Support Event Promotion:**
   - Provide race organisers with effective ways to promote their events, reaching a wider audience of potential participants.

7. **Maintain High-Quality User Support:**
   - Ensure that users can easily contact the site webmaster for assistance, providing reliable support for both runners and race organisers.

## The Strategy Plane

As a thought process of the strategy plane, 5 epics were created and utilised. Please see below the detailed list of epics with links, or a link to the project's Kanban Board ([GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/jdohertydev/projects/4)). These Epics were further sliced into 17 USER STORIES.

## Epics

*** INSERT PICTURE FOR KANBAN BOARD ***

- [EPIC 1: Event Discovery and Browsing](https://github.com/jdohertydev/runit/issues/1)
- [EPIC 2: User Registration and Login](https://github.com/jdohertydev/runit/issues/2)
- [EPIC 3: Event Registration](https://github.com/jdohertydev/runit/issues/3)
- [EPIC 4: Event Management for Organisers](https://github.com/jdohertydev/runit/issues/4)
- [EPIC 5: User Engagement and Community](https://github.com/jdohertydev/runit/issues/5)

## User Stories

## User Stories and Project Metrics

User stories were created based on the Epics, utilising the MoSCoW prioritisation technique. Each user story was estimated for relative effort using a sequence inspired by Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.), which helps capture the uncertainty and variability in estimating task complexity. This non-linear sequence was chosen to provide a clear initial size assessment for each user story.

### Kanban Board Labels

Each user story on our Kanban Board is labelled with two key attributes:

- **MoSCoW Prioritisation**:
  - **Must-Have:** Critical requirements that are essential for project success (14 story points).
  - **Should-Have:** Important requirements that significantly add value (3 story points).
  - **Could-Have:** Desirable features that provide additional benefits (0 story points).
  - **Won't-Have:** Features explicitly excluded from the project scope (23 story points).

### Total Story Points

The total estimation for the project is 40 Story Points.
